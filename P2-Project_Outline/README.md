## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We have an idea for a luxury home service app everyone can use. If anything the pandemic has shown us anything, it is that people want to be able to use their home as a home base.  Delivery services for everything from groceries, medical supplies and even tutors are in demand. We would like to take relaxation to everyone home using a partnership with Massage Therapists to go to a clients house and give that Spa experience at any time.
How it would work is to have a Massage Therapist make a profile with rates, location and types of massage offered. The user would make a profile to search for Massage in their area and schedule on their time. Giving control of the experience for the user to feel empowered while also enjoying a luxury service.

### Features
1) User Login: Users will be able to log into the application and depending if they are a provider or a client be routed to the right log in.
2) Search: Users will be able to search for a therapist in their City and State.
3) Schedule: Users will be able to schedule a date and time for the service to arrive at their residence.

### Technologies
1) Java
2) Gradle
3) Thymeleaf
4) Junit Test Suite
5) Web API
6) MySql
7) Hibernate
8) Spring Boot
9) BootStrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will try to incorporate the Google Maps API into our project. We believe that this will be one of the more difficult aspects. With our current experience we also donâ€™t have the means to make a gorgeous looking UI for our site. We will learn Bootstrap to make a magnificent site.
